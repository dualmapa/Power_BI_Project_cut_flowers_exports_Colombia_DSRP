# Project_cut_flowers_exports_Colombia_Power_BI_DSRP
Hello!

The purpose of this repository is part of an academic analysis carried out in order to use the tool and identify insights.

Although it is a PBI file, it is part of several databases that although they could be related, it was defined to have two separate groups.
Each group refers to exports of Colombian cut flower crops, but from different sources, DANE (Colombian government statistics department) and Veritrade (export and import measurement or registry page).

Each database was worked with Python, SQL, Excel and even Power BI in order to process the data, make the necessary modifications and generate the correct ETL to take the files to Power BI to make the different dashboards.

Different filtering options are presented in both pages, depending on what you want to review, as well as, it is possible to observe that the data are different (values of both exports in dollars and in Colombian pesos or kilos exported, are different in both databases, so they could not be joined).

I hope you can see it, review it and, why not, identify the main objective of each dashboard... Unfortunately there is no name of exporters and importers, but the Veritrade dashboard map, gives a very useful information in the tootips.

I leave you two screenshots and the link of the publication:
